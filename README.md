# 7DTD Modding Tools

**Modding Tools** is a simple mod for _7 Days to Die_ designed to help mod developers test their mods faster or add extra utilities to make modding easier.

> **Disclaimer:** This mod is currently very basic and only includes **one command**: `menu`.

---

## Current Features

- **`menu` command**  
  Allows you to return to the main menu directly from within the game.  
  This command is useful for testing mods, because if an error occurs in-game you may be unable to click anywhere outside the console. Normally, you would have to restart the game to get back to the menu, but this command allows you to do it directly.

## Installation

1. Download the .zip file of this repository.
2. Unzip the contents into your `Mods` folder in your _7 Days to Die_ installation directory.
3. Launch the game normally; the mod will automatically load.
